## Introduction
Are you tired of typing long commands to activate Python virtual environments? **venvat** simplifies this process with a simple command. This tool is designed to streamline the activation of virtual environments, making your workflow more efficient.

## Requirements
Before using **venvat**, ensure the following requirements are met:
- **Python**: This tool requires Python 3.6 or newer. Install Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Virtual Environment**: You should have a virtual environment already set up in your project. `venvat` is designed to activate these environments, not to create them.


### Installing Python
If you need to install Python, you can download it from the official site:

Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/



### Installing pip
If `pip` is not installed, you can install it by downloading `get-pip.py`:

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```


### Installing venvat
To install venvat, run the following command:
```
pip install venvat
```


## Activating Your Virtual Environment

Once `venvat` is installed, you can easily activate your virtual environment. If you're using `venvat` for the first time or if you want to switch to a different virtual environment, you need to specify the name of your virtual environment. Hereâ€™s how:


If your virtual environment is named `venv` you can run:
```
venvat
```

### Specifying a Custom Virtual Environment
If your virtual environment is named differently than the default `venv`, or if you wish to activate a different one, you can specify it directly:

```
venvat --venv your-env-name
```

Reseting your configuration:
```
venvat --reset
```

For more feature, you can explore with:
```
venvat --help
```
